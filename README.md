# AURA Analytics

A privacy-first analytics & insights service for developer productivity and continuous learning trends — built with **Spec‑Driven Development (SDD)**.

- **Docs:** see [`GUIDE.md`](GUIDE.md) and `/docs/*`
- **SpecKit assets:** `/spec/spec.yaml`, `/spec/plan.yaml`, `/spec/tasks.yaml`
- **Backend:** FastAPI starter in `/backend`
- **Run locally:** `docker compose up --build`

> Naming note: the codebase, folders, and filenames avoid vendor names. You can reference external vendor docs in text, but **do not** include vendor names in file paths.
